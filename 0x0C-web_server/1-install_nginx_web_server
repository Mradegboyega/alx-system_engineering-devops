#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configures an Ubuntu server with Nginx installed to serve a custom HTML page

# Install Nginx using apt-get
apt-get update
apt-get install nginx -y

# Ensure Nginx is running. Note: Using 'service' as 'systemctl' is not allowed for this task
service nginx start

# Replace the default Nginx HTML file. This ensures the custom "Hello World!" message is served
echo "Hello World!" > /var/www/html/index.html

# Reload Nginx to apply the changes without using systemctl
service nginx reload

# Note: Nginx by default listens on port 80, so no additional configuration is required for that purpose
