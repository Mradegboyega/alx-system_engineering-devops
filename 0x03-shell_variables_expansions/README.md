This README provides an overview of the shell scripts created to accomplish various tasks. Each script is designed to perform a specific task, and instructions for using each script are provided below.

Script 1: Creating an Alias

This script creates an alias named "ls" with the value "rm *". Please note that this alias will effectively replace the "ls" command with the "rm *" command, which can be very dangerous as it will remove all files in the current directory without confirmation.
Script 2: Adding a Directory to the PATH

This script adds the directory "/action" to the end of the PATH environment variable. This ensures that "/action" is the last directory the shell looks into when searching for programs.
Script 3: Printing Hello User

This script prints "hello" followed by the name of the current Linux user.
Script 4: Listing Environment Variables

This script lists all global (environment) variables, local variables, and functions.
Script 5: Creating a New Local Variable

This script creates a new local variable named "BEST" with the value "School."
Script 6: Creating a New Global-Like Variable

This script creates a global-like variable named "BEST" with the value "School" by exporting it to the environment.
Script 7: Printing the Result of an Addition

This script adds the values stored in the environment variables "NUM1" and "NUM2" and prints the result.
Script 8: Printing Every Other Line

This script prints every other line from the input, starting with the first line.
Script 9: Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal

This script converts a decimal number stored in the environment variable "DECIMAL" to its hexadecimal representation and prints the result.
Script 10: Encoding and Decoding Text using ROT13

This script encodes and decodes text using the ROT13 encryption.
Script 11: Printing the Result of Base 2 to Base 10 Conversion

This script converts a binary number stored in the environment variable "BINARY" to its decimal representation and prints the result.
Script 12: Generating Combinations of Two Letters

This script generates all possible combinations of two lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z', excluding 'oo', and prints them in alphabetical order.
Script 13: Printing a Floating-Point Number with Two Decimal Places

This script prints the value stored in the environment variable "NUM" with two decimal places followed by a new line.
Script 14: Adding Numbers in Different Bases

This script adds the values stored in the environment variables "WATER" and "STIR" (in bases "water" and "stir," respectively) and prints the result in base "bestchol."
